= bio-polyploid-tools

== Introduction
This tools are designed to deal with polyploid wheat. The first tool is to design KASPer primers, making them as specific as possible. 


== Installation
'gem install bio-polyploid-tools'


== Notes

* If the SNP is in a gap in the alignmetn to the chromosomes, it is ignored. 

BUG: Sometimes the primers are reversed (the first comes second)
BUG: Blocks with NNNs are picked and treated as semi-specific. 
TODO: If reading from a reference file, only get one reference to align when the region is queried several times
TODO: Add a parameter file file to tweak the alignments.
